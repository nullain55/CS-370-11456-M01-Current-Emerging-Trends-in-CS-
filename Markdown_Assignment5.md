High Exploration Decay
GAMMA = 0.99  
LEARNING_RATE = 0.001  
EXPLORATION_MAX = 1.0  
EXPLORATION_MIN = 0.01  
EXPLORATION_DECAY = 0.999  

Initial Performance: The agent starts with a high exploration rate, leading to varied scores. The exploration rate decreases slowly.
Score Improvement: There is a gradual improvement in scores, with the highest score reaching 500 in later runs. The average score also improves significantly over time.

Low Exploration Decay
GAMMA = 0.99  
LEARNING_RATE = 0.001 
EXPLORATION_MAX = 1.0  
EXPLORATION_MIN = 0.01  
EXPLORATION_DECAY = 0.9  

Initial Performance: The agent starts with a rapid decrease in the exploration rate. This leads to a quick transition to exploitation.
Score Improvement: The scores improve faster initially compared to high exploration decay. However, there is more volatility in the scores, with frequent low scores even after many runs.

Conclusion
The high exploration decay strategy is more effective for achieving consistent and high performance in the long run. While it may take longer to reach peak performance, the stability and reliability of the agent's performance are superior. 

High Learning Rate
GAMMA = 0.99  
LEARNING_RATE = 0.01 
EXPLORATION_MAX = 1.0  
EXPLORATION_MIN = 0.01 
EXPLORATION_DECAY = 0.995  

Exploration Rate Decay: The exploration rate decreases gradually from 1.0 to approximately 0.07 by run 50.  The exploration rate continues to decrease and stabilizes at the minimum value of 0.01 by run 93.  Stays constant at 0.01, indicating the agent is primarily exploiting the learned policy.

Low Learning Rate
GAMMA = 0.99  
LEARNING_RATE = 0.0001 
EXPLORATION_MAX = 1.0  
EXPLORATION_MIN = 0.01  
EXPLORATION_DECAY = 0.995  

Exploration Rate Decay: The exploration rate decreases gradually from 1.0 to approximately 0.07 by run 50.  The exploration rate continues to decrease and stabilizes at the minimum value of 0.01 by run 92.  Stays constant at 0.01, indicating the agent is primarily exploiting the learned policy.

Conclusion
The analysis of the reinforcement learning algorithm with different learning rates highlights the trade-offs between fast convergence and stability. The high learning rate scenario demonstrates quicker learning and higher final performance, but with some initial variability. The low learning rate scenario shows more stable initial learning but takes longer to achieve optimal performance.

High Discount Factor
GAMMA = 0.999  
LEARNING_RATE = 0.001  
EXPLORATION_MAX = 1.0  
EXPLORATION_MIN = 0.01  
EXPLORATION_DECAY = 0.995  

High Gamma (0.999): This indicates that the agent is more future-oriented, giving almost equal weight to future rewards as to immediate rewards.

Low Discount Factor
GAMMA = 0.90  
LEARNING_RATE = 0.0001 
EXPLORATION_MAX = 1.0  
EXPLORATION_MIN = 0.01  
EXPLORATION_DECAY = 0.995  

Low Gamma (0.90): This means the agent is more short-sighted, valuing immediate rewards more heavily than future rewards.

Conclusion
High Gamma (0.999): The agent learns more gradually, with a focus on long-term rewards. This results in a more stable but slower improvement in performance. 
Low Gamma (0.90): The agent learns more rapidly, focusing on immediate rewards. This leads to quicker performance improvement but may miss out on long-term strategies. 

# Reinforcement Learning and the Cartpole Problem
    
    ## Introduction
    One of the challenges that arise in reinforcemewnt learning, and not in other kinds of learning, is the trade-off between exporlation and exploitation.(Sutton, R. S.)

    Reinforcement learning (RL) is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by taking actions in an environment to maximize cumulative rewards. The cartpole problem is a classic example used to illustrate reinforcement learning concepts. In this problem, an agent must learn to balance a pole on a cart by moving the cart left or right.
    
    ### What is the goal of the agent in this case?
    
    The goal of the agent in the cartpole problem is to keep the pole balanced on the cart for as long as possible.
    
    ### What are the various state values?
    
    In the cartpole problem, the state values are typically represented by the following variables:
    
    Cart Position: The position of the cart on the track.
    Cart Velocity: The velocity of the cart.
    Pole Angle: The angle of the pole with respect to the vertical.
    Pole Angular Velocity: The angular velocity of the pole.
    
    ### What are the possible actions that can be performed?
    
    Actions are the decisions the agent can take to influence the environment. For the cartpole problem, the actions are usually discrete       moves to the left or right.
    
    ### What reinforcement algorithm is used for this problem?
    
    A commonly used reinforcement learning algorithm for the cartpole problem is Q-Learning. Additionally, more advanced algorithms like         Deep Q-Networks (DQN) can also be used.
    
    ### Q-Learning
    
    Q-Learning is a popular RL algorithm that estimates the value of state-action pairs. The Q-value represents the expected cumulative         reward of taking an action in a given state and following the optimal policy thereafter.
    
    ## Analyze how experience replay is applied to the cartpole problem
    
    ### How does experience replay work in this algorithm?
    
    Experience replay is a technique used in reinforcement learning, particularly in Deep Q-Networks (DQN), to stabilize and improve the         learning process. It works by storing the agent's experiences at each time step in a replay memory. During training, the agent randomly     samples mini-batches of experiences from this replay memory to update the Q-values.
    
    ### What is the effect of introducing a discount factor for calculating the future rewards?
    
    The discount factor is a crucial parameter in reinforcement learning that determines the importance of future rewards in the agent's         decision-making process. It affects the calculation of the expected cumulative reward, also known as the return. The discount factor has     several effects on the agent's behavior and learning such as High Discount Factor and Low Discount Factor.
    
    ## Analyze how neural networks are used in deep Q-learning.
    
    In the cartpole problem, a neural network is often used as a function approximator within the Deep Q-Network (DQN) algorithm to estimate     the Q-values for state-action pairs. The architecture of the neural network can vary, but a common choice is a fully connected             feedforward neural network. Here is an overview of a typical neural network architecture used for the cartpole problem:
    
    Input Layer: The input layer size corresponds to the number of state variables. For the cartpole problem, there are typically four input     features: cart position, cart velocity, pole angle, and pole angular velocity.
    
    Hidden Layers: This network usually includes one or more hidden layers.
    
    Output Layer: The output layer size corresponds to the number of possible actions. For the cartpole problem, there are typically three       possible actions: move left or move right.
    
    ### How does the neural network make the Q-learning algorithm more efficient?
    
    By integrating a neural network into the Q-learning framework, DQN addresses the limitations of traditional Q-learning, particularly in     handling large and continuous state spaces.
    
    ### What difference do you see in the algorithm performance when you increase or decrease the learning rate?
    
    High Learning Rate: Leads to faster convergence but increases the risk of instability and overshooting.
    Low Learning Rate: Results in slower convergence but offers more stable and reliable learning.
