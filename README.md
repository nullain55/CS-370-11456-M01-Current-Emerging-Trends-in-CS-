Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?

In this project, the Treasure Hunt Game I was provided with starter code and a sample environment for my pirate agent. The provided code established the basic framework, including the maze structure and the initial functionalities to control the pirate's movements and manage its state within the maze.

My primary responsibility was to develop a deep Q-learning algorithm to train the pirate agent. This involved designing and implementing the learning logic, which required balancing exploration and exploitation, calculating Q-values for different state-action pairs, and continuously updating the agent's policy based on the rewards it received. I utilized a neural network within the Keras environment to approximate the Q-values, enabling the agent to learn from its experiences and refine its decision-making process over time.

Furthermore, I was tasked with writing a design defense to demonstrate my understanding of the core AI concepts applied in creating and training the intelligent agent. This defense included an explanation of how the deep Q-learning algorithm functions, how reinforcement learning was used to optimize the agent's pathfinding strategy, and how AI principles were effectively employed throughout the project to achieve a high success rate in navigating the maze. The design defense also involved comparing human and machine approaches to problem-solving, discussing the ethical considerations in AI development, and linking the project to broader computer science concepts.

What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?

Computer scientists create, develop, and evaluate algorithms, software, and systems to address complex challenges, streamline tasks, and enhance process efficiency in a wide range of industries. They focus on how computers handle information, invent new technologies, and find innovative applications for existing ones. Their work includes building software applications, improving data processing techniques, strengthening cybersecurity measures, and advancing fields like artificial intelligence and machine learning.

How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?

As a computer scientist, I tackle problems through a structured and analytical approach. I begin by clearly defining the problem and breaking it down into smaller, more manageable parts to gain a comprehensive understanding. This involves identifying the specific objectives, constraints, and requirements of the problem.

What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?

As a computer scientist, my ethical responsibilities to both the end user and the organization are essential in ensuring that the technology I develop is both responsible and impactful. For the end user, it is imperative that the software and systems I create are safe, secure, and respectful of privacy. This means implementing strong security protocols to protect sensitive information and prevent unauthorized access or data breaches. Transparency is also key; users deserve to know how the technology operates, what data is being collected, how it is used, and any associated risks. Additionally, I must design technology that is user-friendly and accessible to a broad audience, taking into account the diverse needs and abilities of users. It is equally important to ensure that the technology is fair and unbiased, avoiding any form of discrimination in algorithms, so that all users benefit equally.

For the organization, acting with honesty and integrity is fundamental. This involves accurately communicating the capabilities and limitations of the technology, ensuring that it aligns with the organization’s objectives and values. I am responsible for delivering software that is not only high-quality and reliable but also meets the organization’s standards. This includes rigorous testing, thorough debugging, and continuous maintenance to keep the system functioning effectively. Moreover, I must consider the broader social and ethical impacts of the technology, advising the organization on the responsible use of the systems we develop. This encompasses avoiding harm, upholding user privacy, and advocating for the ethical use of data and algorithms. By adhering to these responsibilities, I contribute to the development of technology that is not only effective and innovative but also ethical and socially responsible.
